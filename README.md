# Variational Inference with Bayesian Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Model

See the theoretical questions and answers that provide the full derivation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), the coordinate ascent mean-field variational inference (CAVI) algorithm, and the optimal variational factor distribution parameter updates. The quetions are in tutorial.pdf and the answers (with most of the derivation) are in PGM_Tutorial_8.pdf.
